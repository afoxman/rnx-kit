For developers using TypeScript 4.7 or later, delegate React Native module resolution to TypeScript, rather than running out own custom resolver. This is possible using the new 'moduleSuffixes' compiler option. Using the TypeScript resolver is best because it supports many more features and is kept up-to-date with the latest changes in the Node ecosystem.
